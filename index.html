              <h1>Biography</h1>
              <p>My name is Antoine Charette. I was born in Quebec City, Canada. The beginning of my life was full of location changes. My family moved from Montreal, to London, to San Jose, finally ending up in Seattle. I grew up in an area called the Sammamish Plateau and made most of my friends through sports and similar interests. When I attended high school, I was lucky to be part of the multiple State Championship winning football team, the Skyline Spartans. I started university at the age of 16 but was never confident in my career choices, spending a total of 5 years jumping from major to major. Although I was pursuing a baccalaureate in Chemical Engineering for most of my time at university, I was introduced to software development through elective courses. I attended culinary school at the age of 22, graduated with honors, and began a short but entertaining career as a chef at Restaurant Les Foug&egraveres, just north of Ottawa. I worked there until mid-way through the coronavirus pandemic and am now pursuing a career in software development.</p>
